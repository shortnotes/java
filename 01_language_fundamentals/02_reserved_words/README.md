| **void** | Specifies that a method does not have a return value |
| **enum** | ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.5-green) A Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class. |
---

**NOTE** 01

  1. In java return type is mandatory, if a method doesn't return anything then we have to declare the method with void return type.
  2. Usage of goto created several problems hence it is banned in Java.
  3. Use final instead of const
  4. The keywords const and goto are reserved, even they are not currently in use.
  5. We can use `enum` to define a group of named constants.

Example of enum:

``` java
enum month {
    JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,MAY,JUN,JUL,AUG,SEPT,OCT,NOV,DEC
}
```

## Conclusions

1. All 53 reserved words contains `lower-case alphabets` only
    `instanceof, strictfp`
2. In Java we have only `new` keyword and there is no `delete` keyword because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of **Garbage Collector**.
3. The following are newly added Keywords in Java:

    * `strictfp` ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.2-green)
    * `assert` ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.4-green)
    * `enum` ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.5-green)

**NOTE** 02

1. `strictfp` but not `strictFp`
2. `instanceof` but not `instanceOf`
3. `synchonized` but not `synchronise`
4. `extends` but not `extend`
5. `implements` but not `implement`
6. `import` but not `imports`
7. `const` but not `constant`

## Answers

|Sr. No. | word | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1. | **new**, delete | `delete` is not a keyword in Java |
| 2. | **goto**, constant | `const` is keyword, `constant` is not a keyword |
| 3. | **break, continue, return**, exit | `exit` is not a keyword in Java (Method)|
| 4. | **final, finally**, finalize | `finalize` is not a keyword in Java |
| 5. | **throw, throws**, thrown | `thrown` is not a Keyword in Java |
| 6. | notify, notifyAll | both are not Java Keywords. (Methods)|
| 7. | **implements, extends**, imports | `imports` is not a Java Keywords |
| 8. | sizeof, **instanceof** | `sizeof` is not a Java Keyword |
| 9. | instanceOf, strictFp | Java keywords contain `lower-case` alphabets only |
| 10.| **byte, short**, Int| Java keywords contain `lower-case` alphabets only |
| 11.| None of Above | **Solution:** No list contains Java keywords only. |

Q. Which of the following are Java reserved words?

`public, static, void, main, String, args` :\
First three only. String is a **'pre-defined'** class name.
